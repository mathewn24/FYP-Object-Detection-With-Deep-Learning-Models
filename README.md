# FYP 2022-23: Object Detection with Deep Learning Models
## By: mathewn24

This repository tracks my Final Year Project that I did with my professor. During this project I worked on running, training, and finetuning different deep learning architectures using Pytorch and an open source Deep Learning library called OpenMMLab (http://github.com/open-mmlab). 

The models were trained and optimised using different techniques, such as through various batch sizes, model depth, different CNN backbones, as well as training times and different amounts of GPUs. Results were then compared using standard metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), confusion matricies, as well as comparing model training time and accuracy to get a better idea of which model is suited for each task.
